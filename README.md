# PaperReplication
We have performed an experiment to replicate the result of **Test Re-prioritization in Continuous Testing Environments** paper. Due to the size restriction of github we couldn't upload the dataset alongside with the source code. Dataset is separately hosted in google drive.

2. Click **DOWNLOAD ALL** on the top-right corner of the page.
3. A zip file will be downloaded.
4. Extract the zip file and copy the dataset directory inside project directory.
